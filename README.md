## 🚀 About Me

I’m a 19-year-old Computer Engineering student passionate about information security, systems programming, and ethical technology. With strong fundamentals in the C language family and Java, I aim to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity — from secure coding to system analysis and threat detection.

I’m currently enhancing my skills through hands-on coding projects, self-study, and independent research while actively exploring certifications like CompTIA Security+ and Cisco CCNA.
